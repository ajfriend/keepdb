## Goals

- build a modern (uses `pyproject.toml` instead of `setup.py`), well-organized, python project
	- try out latest patterns for use in other projects
	- provide examples
	- run coverage on tests also!
	- use ruff, but only with single quotes for chrissake

## Alternatives

- save as a SQLite database?
- save as duckdb database?
- HDF5?
