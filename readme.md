## Goals

- build a modern (uses `pyproject.toml` instead of `setup.py`), well-organized, python project
	- try out latest patterns for use in other projects
	- provide examples
	- run coverage on tests also!
	- use ruff, but only with single quotes for chrissake

## Alternatives

- save as a SQLite database?
- save as duckdb database?
- HDF5?


## TODO

- better project name?
- github install instructions
- pypi package
- how best to separate:
	- minimum viable code to install package
	- test package
	- develop, with helper stuff like jupyter lab
	- make an "aggressive version" that just uses pyarrow!
